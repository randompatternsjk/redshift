I said, “Elizabeth, I know
You can’t wait to get out of here  
But I bet you’ll look back when you’re leaving”  
We were the lone lights on the road  
Drifting over county lines  
A bottle at our feet
She said, “I know this place too well
To lose myself
And I just wanna lose myself again”
And “we could die tonight
But there’s thousands yet ahead and I...
I can’t spend ‘em here”

And I said,
“If you end up wrecking all alone
So far from your name you can’t be found
And stranded like a cross on a gravel road
Who’d be the one to bring you flowers?
Who’d be the one to bring you flowers?”

I said, “Elizabeth, there is a grace
In dying in the very place
You were born”
In the dashboard glow
I swore I saw her eyes roll
Or stow away a tear
I said, “I know you way too well
You’ll never really lose yourself
I bet we never get to lose ourselves again”
She said “Your love is setting slow
Like concrete around my bones
I can’t end up here”

But if she ends up wrecking when she goes
So far from the home where she was bound
Stuck, standing like a cross on a gravel road
I will be the one to bring her flowers
I will be the one to bring her flowers
I will be the one to bring her flowers
