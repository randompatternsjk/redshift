Let a light down through the clouds
I swore this storm would break by now
It billows and it drums
But nothing ever comes

And my heart is wearing out
Beaten like a cornered mouse
Hoping for a sign
A peace I just can’t find

What if nothing ever comes
And everything is never enough
To raise me from despair
The weight when nothing’s there?

But still I wait my turn
As if mercy might be earned
And weren’t some random pattern
In the sky
And still I sing this prayer
Though I know there’s nothing there
There’s a light I’ve felt
But every time it fell
My chin was tilted down

There must be something here…
There must be something here…
There must be something here…
