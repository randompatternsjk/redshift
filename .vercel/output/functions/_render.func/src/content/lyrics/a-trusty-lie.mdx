The ninth drink delivers
The lines you've prewritten
And a voice like yours admits no wrong
I swirl the ice inside my glass
Drowning out the very last words
I should say

I guess that
Everybody’s got a trusty lie they tell
We fool ourselves with our own sleight of hand
Everybody’s got a trusty lie they tell to themselves
Keep it in your head
Careful now, don’t let it wriggle out

One sincere sentence
And six years is ended
Instead my voice sounds strange when I speak to you
How’d we wind up here?
Why do I stay?
Repeat it one last time: "It's just for one more day”

‘Cuz everybody’s got a trusty lie they tell
We fool ourselves with our own sleight of hand
Everybody’s got a trusty lie they keep to themselves
It sounds right your head
Careful now…

Oh!
If I met you here tonight
For the first time
I’d run the other way
Oh!
That’s a good one!

Everybody’s got a trusty lie they tell to themselves
It’s safe inside your head
So careful now…
Careful now…
Careful now…
Don’t let it…
Wriggle out
