I hear the drum of a desperate moth
Caught in the screen and glass
The streetlights reach in through the curtain cloth
Stretching the shadows cast

We pick ourselves from the city’s teeth
Throw some worn-out record on
And each of our breaths is deafening
In the silence between each song

Honey, don’t love me please
I’m not the man I thought I’d be

You say “Sometimes it’s like I’m a guest
‘In hell everything is fine’”
And the words are like stones through a hornet’s nest
“There’s worse things to lose than time”

Honey, don’t: Love me please
I’m not the man that I wanna be

Oh, and days burn down
A pile of ashes
On the ground
And seasons that we
Wait it out
Go passing in a breeze
Days burn down
And all the time you
Swore wont count
It passes in a
Breeze and now
It’s you and i alone

You say “I’d murder the fuckers
I’d wring all their god-damned throats
We’ll never find cover
But the demons aren’t yours alone”

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, mmm

So let ‘em out,
Let ‘em out on me
Let ‘em out”

Another night in our pleasant hell
A swarm starts rising from my chest
