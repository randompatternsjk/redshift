So
Before we go
There’s something you ought to know
There are bones
In the shipwrecks below
Holding their dying pose
And they went
Clawing for breath
Clinging to hope that
They would make it

Out
Mmm
Out

And when
The panic sets in
And your body betrays you
Your screams won’t make a sound
You gotta kick like hell
And save yourself somehow
Knowing you’ll drown
Clinging to hope
That you might make it

Out
Out
Out
Ohh…

And if
You kick till you hit
Grab a handful of mud
To prove you made it
Down
