You can’t wait to get out of here  
But I bet you’ll look back when you’re leaving”  
We were the lone lights on the road  
Drifting over county lines  
A bottle at our feet
She said, “I know this place too well
To lose myself
And I just wanna lose myself again”
And “we could die tonight
But there’s thousands yet ahead and I...
I can’t spend ‘em here”

And I said,
“If you end up wrecking all alone
So far from your name you can’t be found
And stranded like a cross on a gravel road
Who’d be the one to bring you flowers?
Who’d be the one to bring you flowers?”

I said, “Elizabeth, there is a grace
In dying in the very place
You were born”
In the dashboard glow
I swore I saw her eyes roll
Or stow away a tear
I said, “I know you way too well
You’ll never really lose yourself
I bet we never get to lose ourselves again”
She said “Your love is setting slow
Like concrete around my bones
I can’t end up here”

But if she ends up wrecking when she goes
So far from the home where she was bound
Stuck, standing like a cross on a gravel road
I will be the one to bring her flowers
I will be the one to bring her flowers
I will be the one to bring her flowers </div> </article><article class="song-card bg-card-bg p-4 ml-4flex flex-col items-start justify-center transition-transform duration-200 ease-in-out"> <img src="/images/song-arts/sleeveless-hearts.jpg" alt="Sleeveless Hearts album art" class="w-full h-auto object-cover"> <h2 class="text-left text-dark font-bold mt-4">Sleeveless Hearts</h2> <div class="lyrics-body text-justify text-dark text-sm mt-4 text-wrap whitespace-pre">your sleeveless heart
it starts its fire for the night
kindles its conviction with some lines
from books you’ve barely put a crease in
you’re in the dark
and all lit up on your father’s gin
you nihilist, you feel no consequence
of needing nothing to believe in

born again… again
you got a soul to sell
you’re so certain when
it comes from someone else
yes, and you’ll defend
every single part
screaming like you mean it
from your sleeveless heart

you sleep past noon
and wake with smoke still in your head
the embers cool
those revelations left you cold again
you’re so desperate to believe
in yourself or anything—anything at all
but now they sound so hollow like in an empty cathedral hall
the echoes of your own voice screaming

born again… again
got no soul to sell
when your sermon ends
you’re orphaned to yourself
nothing to defend
nothing to impart
nothing but the heat

Warning us to double back
But we trudge through the boot prints
Strangers cut through this
And make it out in someone else’s tracks
Gentler weather held you together
But this rough stretch rends your seams
The sidewalks go jagged
And the highways fracture
It’s hard to stay and harder still to leave

Cold creeps in the cracks
The delicate can’t last

And the ice is gonna try to break us
The ice is gonna try to break us up
Yeah, the ice is gonna try to break us
The ice is gonna try to break us up

Seven months ago, you were invincible
And your misery took so little strength to conceal   
But the winds found the weakness
At your collar and sleeves
In the promises you’re keeping
In your vow not to leave
So as you shatter to pieces
Fall into me
I could hold you all together till you heal

Cold creeps in the cracks
And it widens them and weakens everything

And the ice is gonna try to break us
The ice is gonna try to break us up
Yeah, the ice is gonna try to break us
The ice is gonna try to break us up

The ice is gonna try to break us (Everybody falls apart here)
The ice is gonna try to break us up (Everything just falls apart here)

The lines you&#39;ve prewritten

Drowning out the very last words

I guess that
Everybody’s got a trusty lie they tell
We fool ourselves with our own sleight of hand
Everybody’s got a trusty lie they tell to themselves
Keep it in your head
Careful now, don’t let it wriggle out

One sincere sentence
And six years is ended
Instead my voice sounds strange when I speak to you
How’d we wind up here?
Why do I stay?
Repeat it one last time: &quot;It&#39;s just for one more day”

‘Cuz everybody’s got a trusty lie they tell
We fool ourselves with our own sleight of hand
Everybody’s got a trusty lie they keep to themselves

Careful now…

Oh!
If I met you here tonight
For the first time
I’d run the other way
Oh!

You can stay with me

I could’a slept through Stalingrad
I let the neighbors hunt the land

Caught in the screen and glass
The streetlights reach in through the curtain cloth
Stretching the shadows cast

We pick ourselves from the city’s teeth
Throw some worn-out record on
And each of our breaths is deafening
In the silence between each song

Honey, don’t love me please
I’m not the man I thought I’d be

You say “Sometimes it’s like I’m a guest
‘In hell everything is fine’”
And the words are like stones through a hornet’s nest
“There’s worse things to lose than time”

Honey, don’t: Love me please
I’m not the man that I wanna be

Oh, and days burn down
A pile of ashes
On the ground
And seasons that we
Wait it out
Go passing in a breeze
Days burn down
And all the time you
Swore wont count
It passes in a
Breeze and now
It’s you and i alone

You say “I’d murder the fuckers
I’d wring all their god-damned throats
We’ll never find cover
But the demons aren’t yours alone”

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, mmm

So let ‘em out,
Let ‘em out on me
Let ‘em out”

A swarm starts rising from my chest </div> </article><article class="song-card bg-card-bg p-4 ml-4flex flex-col items-start justify-center transition-transform duration-200 ease-in-out"> <img src="/images/song-arts/redshift.jpg" alt="Redshift album art" class="w-full h-auto object-cover"> <h2 class="text-left text-dark font-bold mt-4">Redshift</h2> <div class="lyrics-body text-justify text-dark text-sm mt-4 text-wrap whitespace-pre">It&#39;s the 42nd parallel
But half of this bar
They talk like they&#39;re from somewhere else
With a fake southern drawl
It&#39;s like I turned the AM dial
Sliding through to get a beer
I&#39;ll stick around a little while
But I don&#39;t wanna be long here

They fly the rebel flag in Michigan
They&#39;re born with the right
Grandkids of militiamen
Bred for the fight
I hear these villains playing victim
Though they&#39;re falling on deaf ears
The same words sounded different
Back when I belonged here
Those same words sounded different
Back when I belonged here

I knew these men as kids
When I was like &#39;em myself
Righteous with an ignorance
Unknown to itself
But gravity took over
I saw a world beyond this sphere
If it&#39;d pulled me closer
I still might belong here

Instead, I came back every Christmas
Bit my tongue till it bled
Felt my closest grow distant
As their blue blood went red
Felt &#39;em recognize a stranger
Too far gone to draw in near
Didn&#39;t notice I was changing
Till I didn&#39;t belong here
Didn&#39;t notice I was changing
Till I didn&#39;t belong here

Now, I&#39;m drunk under the glimmer
Of a thousand more stars
And they&#39;ll go red as they grow dimmer
Till they&#39;re lost to the dark
I&#39;ll be restless in my searching
As heaven disappears
Man, I used to be so certain
Back when I belonged here

So here&#39;s to every nowhere village
To the dark-hidden stars
To the places god no longer visits
Or sends his regards
I left here for a reason
Way back then it wasn&#39;t clear
With some distance now I see it
I don&#39;t wanna belong here
With some distance now I see it
I don&#39;t wanna belong here </div> </article><article class="song-card bg-card-bg p-4 ml-4flex flex-col items-start justify-center transition-transform duration-200 ease-in-out"> <img src="/images/song-arts/hallelujah-clouds.jpg" alt="Hallelujah Clouds album art" class="w-full h-auto object-cover"> <h2 class="text-left text-dark font-bold mt-4">Hallelujah Clouds</h2> <div class="lyrics-body text-justify text-dark text-sm mt-4 text-wrap whitespace-pre">Let a light down through the clouds

It billows and it drums
But nothing ever comes

And my heart is wearing out
Beaten like a cornered mouse
Hoping for a sign
A peace I just can’t find

What if nothing ever comes
And everything is never enough
To raise me from despair
The weight when nothing’s there?

But still I wait my turn
As if mercy might be earned
And weren’t some random pattern
In the sky
And still I sing this prayer
Though I know there’s nothing there
There’s a light I’ve felt
But every time it fell
My chin was tilted down

Nursing all his lone regrets

Once what’s ahead is the distant past
And all of the life that you left to chance
Wastes away?
Wastes away?

Sipping something on the rocks
Spinning on a moonlit dock
Numb as an old bruise
I’m poring over everything
I got regrets ahead of me
But I’m wondering which ones I’ll choose
And which choose me instead

What will I have when I’m looking back?
Once what’s ahead is the distant past
The sum of a life that was left to chance
What will I have?
Man, I don’t know, but

“Are gonna be hard”

And there’s questions that I’m
Too terrified to ask
Yeah…

Feel the harsh light
Of the red morning sun
You can wait your whole life
For an answer that won’t come

But if the chyrons start
I hope that you’re walking in a field,
Counting stars
None of this Hemingway crap
Just running the dog through the
Tall hissing grass
You could stock your shelter
Till the big one hits
How long do you figure an apocalypse is?
And what’ll you do till then?
Till the end time begins?
Till the end time begins?

Why’d you hunker
Down there on your own?
Fighting demons
Like they’re yours alone?
‘Cuz if you believe
There’s a shred of a chance
We’re not doomed
Stop saving
Your soul and
Put the damned thing to use

‘Cuz yes I promise I’m a lot like you

Out

And when
The panic sets in
And your body betrays you
Your screams won’t make a sound
You gotta kick like hell
And save yourself somehow
Knowing you’ll drown
