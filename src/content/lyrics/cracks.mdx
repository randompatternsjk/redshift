All the trees flail their skeleton hands
Warning us to double back
But we trudge through the boot prints
Strangers cut through this
And make it out in someone else’s tracks
Gentler weather held you together
But this rough stretch rends your seams
The sidewalks go jagged
And the highways fracture
It’s hard to stay and harder still to leave

Cold creeps in the cracks
The delicate can’t last

And the ice is gonna try to break us
The ice is gonna try to break us up
Yeah, the ice is gonna try to break us
The ice is gonna try to break us up

Seven months ago, you were invincible
And your misery took so little strength to conceal   
But the winds found the weakness
At your collar and sleeves
In the promises you’re keeping
In your vow not to leave
So as you shatter to pieces
Fall into me
I could hold you all together till you heal

Cold creeps in the cracks
And it widens them and weakens everything

And the ice is gonna try to break us
The ice is gonna try to break us up
Yeah, the ice is gonna try to break us
The ice is gonna try to break us up

The ice is gonna try to break us (Everybody falls apart here)
The ice is gonna try to break us up (Everything just falls apart here)
Yeah, the ice is gonna try to break us (I was gonna try to heal ya)
The ice is gonna try to break us up (I was gonna try to heal ya)
