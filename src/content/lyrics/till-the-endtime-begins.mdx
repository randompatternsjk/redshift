Blue
Bleeds through the blinds
Another new year
The same old lang synes
Come…
Come…

I saved your birthday cards
“Your twenties,” you wrote
“Are gonna be hard”
But there’s empty fifths in your trash
And there’s questions that I’m
Too terrified to ask
Yeah…

Feel the harsh light
Of the red morning sun
You can wait your whole life
For an answer that won’t come

But if the chyrons start
I hope that you’re walking in a field,
Counting stars
None of this Hemingway crap
Just running the dog through the
Tall hissing grass
You could stock your shelter
Till the big one hits
How long do you figure an apocalypse is?
And what’ll you do till then?
Till the end time begins?
Till the end time begins?

Why’d you hunker
Down there on your own?
Fighting demons
Like they’re yours alone?
‘Cuz if you believe
There’s a shred of a chance
We’re not doomed
Stop saving
Your soul and
Put the damned thing to use

‘Cuz yes I promise I’m a lot like you
I’ve never been so sure of our certain doom
But what do we do till then?
Till the end time begins?
Till the end time begins?
