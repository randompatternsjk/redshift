your sleeveless heart
it starts its fire for the night
kindles its conviction with some lines
from books you’ve barely put a crease in
you’re in the dark
and all lit up on your father’s gin
you nihilist, you feel no consequence
of needing nothing to believe in

born again… again
you got a soul to sell
you’re so certain when
it comes from someone else
yes, and you’ll defend
every single part
screaming like you mean it
from your sleeveless heart

you sleep past noon
and wake with smoke still in your head
the embers cool
those revelations left you cold again
you’re so desperate to believe
in yourself or anything—anything at all
but now they sound so hollow like in an empty cathedral hall
the echoes of your own voice screaming

born again… again
got no soul to sell
when your sermon ends
you’re orphaned to yourself
nothing to defend
nothing to impart
nothing but the heat
of a sleeveless heart
